    <p>Hello {{ username }},</p>

    <p>
      We wanted to let you know that two-factor authentication (2FA) has been successfully enabled for your account on {{ enabled_at }} UTC.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you did not enable two-factor authentication, please contact support
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p>For security reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your backup codes in a safe place</li>
      <li>Do not share your authentication codes with anyone</li>
      <li>Consider using a password manager to store your backup codes</li>
    </ul>
